class ClassAssocationRule():
    """ClassAssociationRule (CAR) is defined by its antecedent, consequent,
    support, confidence and id. 

    It has a set of Items in its antecedent and one Item in its
    Consequent. 

    __lt__ and __gt__ operators are overriden so that list of CARs can
    be sorted.  
    
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    
    antecedent: Antecedent
        Items that a Transaction has to satisfy
   
    consequent: Consequent
        Target class of a Transaction that satisfies
        antecedent
    
    support: float
        how many transactions satisfy the rule, relatively
    
    confidence: float
        relative degree of certainty that consequent holds
        given antecedent



    Attributes
    ----------
    antecedent

    conseqent

    support

    confidence

    rid: int
        rule id

    support_count: int
        absolute support count

    marked: bool

    class_cases_covered: collections.Counter
        counter for determining which transactions are
        covered by the antecedent. Important for M2Algorithm.
    
    replace: set of ClassAssociationRule
        set of rules that have higher precedence than
        this rule and can replace it in M2Algorithm.
